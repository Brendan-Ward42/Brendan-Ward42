### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
If you found this repository, then you're either in my Data and Digital Stewardship class or my professor. Regardless, welcome!


I am a graduate student at Drexel University working on a degree in Library and Information Science. I am still discovering what I completely want to do with my life, but I do know that I want to be a librarian. As far back as I can remember, I've loved the library. Some of my fondest childhood memories are visiting my local library with my mom. About a year ago, I decided to make a career change and I realized I wanted to help the next generation have a similar experience with the library.

I found this repository that collects and stores play-by-play data for baseball games dating  all the way back to 1920. https://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm
